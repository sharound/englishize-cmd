     [ What? ]

  #  Change non-English CMD interface to English in Windows 7/Vista
  
  #  For the full story, read the article:

     [ How-to ]
  
  1. "Englishize.bat" for changing command line tools from non-English to
      English. (Requires admin rights) 
      
  2. "Restore.bat" to restore everything back to original language. (Requires
      admin rights)
      
  3. "_lang_codes.txt" is a modifiable list containing all non-English language
      codes. It includes most languages but in case your language is not there,
      add it and "Englishize Cmd" will support it.
      
  4. "_files_to_process.txt" is a modifiable list of file names of command-line
     executables that will be affected in the change. All commands in Windows
     Vista and 7 should be covered (although it contains much more commands
     than there actually are, it doesn't matter because it has no effect on
     commands that don't exist.) If you decide some commands are better left
     localized rather than being changed to English, remove them from this list
     before running "Englishize.bat". Also, although the list covers command-
     line executables, you can add GUI -- Graphical User Interface - programs
     such as Paint - mspaint.exe and lots of others to "_files_to_process.txt".
     There is a limitation here though. Windows comes with both English and 
     non-English .mui files for command-line programs only; by default .mui for
     GUI programs don't exist in en-US folder until users install the English
     MUI through Windows Update) or Vistalizator (for non-Ultimate/Enterprise
     Windows users).
